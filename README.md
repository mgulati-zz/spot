Go places with friends

Uses Socket.io and Google Maps Api to calculate the time to destination from multiple people based on mode of transportation. Automatically updates location, works on mobile and desktop. The bottom shows a normalized linear "race" to the destination.

When you visit the site, you will be placed in a random room (check the url). You can share this diretly or using the facebook message share button on the site. Destination is simply set by clicking, and colors are randomly assigned for up to six people after which everyone defaults to blak.
